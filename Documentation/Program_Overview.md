## Game Flow and Mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Character Input**: Process WASD (FireBoy) and Arrow Keys (WaterGirl)
2. **Physics Update**: Apply gravity, handle jumping, process movement
3. **Collision Detection**: Check platform collisions and resolve positions
4. **Interaction Checks**: Test for hazard collisions, door interactions, diamond collection
5. **Rendering**: Draw background, tiles, objects, and characters
6. **State Management**: Check win/lose conditions

### Winning Conditions
- Both FireBoy and WaterGirl must reach their respective exit doors
- Doors activate when the correct character enters the area
- Doors deactivate if the character leaves the area
- Level completes only when both doors are simultaneously active

### Losing Conditions
- Any character touches a hazard they're not immune to
- Game immediately ends with "GAME OVER" message

### Character Mechanics
- **Elemental Immunity**: Characters are immune to hazards of their own element
- **Cooperative Gameplay**: Both characters must survive and reach exits
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic gravity, jumping, and momentum
- **Precision Controls**: Designed for puzzle-solving and careful navigation

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern**: GameObject hierarchy with abstract Draw/Update methods
2. **Abstract Factory Pattern**: GameObjectFactoryManager with specific factory implementations
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Character input handling through abstract methods
