# Swinburne OOP HD Project - FireBoy and WaterGirl Game

## Project Summary

This is a C# implementation of a **FireBoy and WaterGirl** puzzle platformer game built using the **SplashKit** game framework and **DotTiled** for level loading. The game features two playable characters who must work together to complete levels while avoiding hazards, collecting diamonds, and reaching their respective exit doors.

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8.0)
- **Game Framework**: SplashKit SDK
- **Level Editor**: Tiled Map Editor (TMX files)
- **Dependencies**: DotTiled (0.3.0) for TMX parsing

## Architecture Overview

The program follows **Object-Oriented Programming** principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **State Management System**: Game states for menu, playing, and game over
- **Character System**: Abstract base class inheriting from SolidObject
- **Game Object Hierarchy**: Separate hierarchies for solid and interactable objects
- **Factory Pattern**: For dynamic object creation from level data
- **Physics Engine**: Static class handling movement and collision detection
- **Level Management**: TMX file parsing and game state management
- **Collision System**: Centralized collision detection and response

## Key Design Decisions

### Inheritance Structure
The game uses a **dual inheritance hierarchy**:
1. **SolidObject**: For objects affected by physics (characters, boxes, platforms)
2. **InteractableObject**: For objects that can be interacted with (buttons, levers, hazards, diamonds, doors)

This allows for clean separation of concerns while avoiding multiple inheritance issues.

### State Management
The **GameStateManager** uses a stack-based approach for state transitions, allowing for:
- Easy pause/resume functionality
- Clean state transitions
- Modular state implementations

### Factory Pattern
The **Abstract Factory pattern** enables:
- Dynamic object creation from level data
- Easy addition of new object types
- Centralized object creation logic

## Game Flow

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Input Processing**: Handle character movement and interactions
2. **Physics Update**: Apply gravity, movement, and collision detection
3. **Interaction Checks**: Process hazard collisions, door interactions, diamond collection
4. **Rendering**: Draw all game objects with proper layering
5. **State Management**: Check win/lose conditions and handle state transitions

### Character Mechanics
- **Elemental Immunity**: Characters are immune to hazards of their element
- **Cooperative Gameplay**: Both characters must reach their respective exits
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic gravity, jumping, and momentum

### Level Completion
- **Dual Exit Requirement**: Both characters must simultaneously be at their exits
- **Scoring System**: Based on completion time and diamonds collected
- **Progression Tracking**: Level completion status and high scores

## Technical Highlights

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between solid objects and interactable objects
- **State Management**: Robust state system for menu, gameplay, and game over
- **Physics Integration**: Realistic physics simulation with AABB collision detection
- **Animation System**: Comprehensive sprite animation with state-based transitions
- **Level Editor Support**: Direct TMX file integration for level design
